# Josh Mock is online

Current lead maintainer of the official [Elasticsearch client for Node.js](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-js) and Elastic's dynamic language client tech lead.

I (poorly) maintain a blog of technical and non-technical thoughts at [joshmock.com](https://joshmock.com). It is a [generated static site](https://github.com/JoshMock/indieweb), built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)).

Linux tinkerer, currently running Arch Linux as my daily driver, but working on a [custom Fedora Atomic image](https://github.com/JoshMock/blue-build-hyprland) with all my various tweaks. If this interests you, [my dotfiles](https://github.com/JoshMock/dotfiles) may be worth perusing.

I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) as my daily editor/IDE. I have used config distros like LazyVim, but typically find them too heavy, and tend to lean on [my own custom config](https://github.com/JoshMock/dotfiles/blob/main/home/dot_config/nvim-kickstart/init.lua), which itself leans heavily on [mini.nvim](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim) and [snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim).

Some other open source tools I use/abuse often include:

- [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/)
- [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/)
- [Bugwarrior](https://bugwarrior.readthedocs.io)
- [Timewarrior](https://timewarrior.net/)
- [Mopidy](https://mopidy.com/)
- [Beets](https://beets.readthedocs.io/)
